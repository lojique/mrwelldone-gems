```bash
# opens a ports on 31337 to bind to
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/4761
```


Once you run the exploit nmap the IP again and look for a new open port specifically 31337 it will now be open and you can connect to it via nc. once connected for a stable shell go ahead and use the ssh method

nmap 10.10.10.10 -p31337
